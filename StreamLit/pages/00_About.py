        **MyChart Explorer** is an experimental platform intended for experienced users (for example, software developers) who want to explore their personal health records locally and privately.

        The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate how we can democratize access to our own medical records to maintain and improve our health. In the long run, approaches like this can help lower the burden on care providers and improve the overall quality of care.

        You can run everything on your own machine without any cloud keys:

        1. Install **Ollama** from https://ollama.com (Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`).
        2. Pull a local model (e.g., `gpt-oss:20b` or `llama3`): `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b`.
        3. In the app, open **Settings â†’ LLM Provider**, choose **ollama**, and set model name.
        4. Launch the app locally and use the **MyChart Explorer** page. No external API calls are required.

        With this setup, data and inference stay on your machine.

        - If your server is directly reachable, set the **Ollama URL** on the **Settings** page (e.g., `http://server.local:11434`).
        - If itâ€™s behind a firewall/NAT, use the built-in **SSH Tunnel** (Settings â†’ SSH Tunnel for Remote Ollama):
          1. Enter SSH host/user (and key/passphrase if needed).
          2. Click **Start SSH Tunnel**.
          3. Set **Ollama URL** to the local tunnel (e.g., `http://localhost:11435`).

        This keeps inference on your own hardware while letting you use the app from your laptop.
