    Google's Gemini models are powerful and can be accessed via an API key. You can get a free key to start.

    1.  **Go to Google AI Studio:** Open your web browser and navigate to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).
    2.  **Sign In:** Sign in with your Google account.
    3.  **Get API Key:**
        *   Once you are in the AI Studio, look for a button or link that says **"Get API key"**. This is typically found in the top-left or top-right corner of the page.
        *   Click on it, and you will be prompted to create an API key in a new project.
    4.  **Create and Copy Key:**
        *   Follow the on-screen instructions to create your new API key.
        *   Once generated, a long string of characters will be displayed. This is your API key. **Copy this key immediately and save it somewhere safe.** You will not be able to see the full key again.
    5.  **Set the Key in the Application:**
        *   Go to the **"Settings"** page in the MyChart Explorer application.
        *   Paste your copied API key into the field labeled **"Gemini API Key"**.
        *   Click **"Save Settings"**.
    
    The application is now configured to use the Gemini models for inference.

    > **Note for Power Users:** The free API key has usage limits. If you require more extensive use, you can enable billing on your Google Cloud project to access higher limits and paid tiers of the Gemini API.
