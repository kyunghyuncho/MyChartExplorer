1.  **Log In:** Navigate to the NYU Langone MyChart portal and log in:
    [https://mychart.nyulmc.org/mychart](https://mychart.nyulmc.org/mychart)

2.  **Navigate to "Share My Record":** Once logged in, click on the **"Menu"** button, and find the **"Share My Record"** option under the "Sharing" section.

3.  **Choose "Yourself":** On the "Share My Record" page, you will see options for who to share with. Click on the **"Yourself"** option.

4.  **Download a Snapshot:** Select the option to **"Download or send a snapshot of your health record."**

5.  **Select Records:** Choose **"All Visits"** to get a complete record. Then press **"Continue"**.

6.  **Wait for Notification:** The system will prepare your files. This may take some time. You should receive an email from MyChart when your download is ready.

7.  **Download and Unzip:** Follow the link in the email to download a `.zip` file. Unzip this file on your computer.

8.  **Locate XML Files:** Inside the unzipped folder, you should find a directory structure similar to `IHE_XDM/`. Your XML health records will be inside a sub-folder, for instance `IHE_XDM/[your first name]1/`. These are the files you will use with the **Data Importer** page in this app.
