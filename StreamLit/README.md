# MyChart Explorer (Streamlit)

A Streamlit application to explore and consult on your MyChart-exported health data. It ingests MyChart XML, stores it in SQLite, retrieves relevant records via safe, read-only SQL generated by an LLM (Ollama or Gemini), and then consults on those records.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- macOS or Linux recommended
- Recommended: a virtual environment
- Optional: GPU-backed Ollama for local LLMs, or a Gemini API key

## Setup

```bash
# from the StreamLit folder
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS Prerequisites

If you are on macOS, you may need to install `sqlcipher` for the database encryption features to work.

```bash
brew install sqlcipher
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlcipher/include"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlcipher/lib"
# Now, run the pip install command
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
# from the StreamLit folder
streamlit run Home.py
```

The app is a multipage app. Use the left sidebar to navigate pages.

## User Registration and Security

This application supports multi-user environments by providing a user registration and login system.

- **User Accounts**: Each user can create their own account to keep their health data, configuration, and conversations private.
- **Data Isolation**: Your data is stored in a user-specific directory and is only accessible after you log in.
- **Getting Started**: New users should go to the "Register" page from the sidebar to create an account. Existing users can log in on the Home page.

## Pages Overview

- Register: Create a user account to save your data and conversations.
- MyChart Explorer (Chat): ask questions; the app retrieves relevant data and consults on it.
- Database Explorer: browse tables and rows.
- Data Importer: import your MyChart XML into a local SQLite DB.
- Settings: configure LLM backend, models, Gemini key, and SSH tunnel.
- Instructions: How to use the app.

## Backends: Ollama and Gemini

- Switch backend in two places:
  - Sidebar of MyChart Explorer (quick switch)
  - Settings page (persist model names and other details)
- Gemini
  - Set your API key in Settings.
  - Default model: `gemini-2.5-pro` (you can change it on the Settings page).
- Ollama
  - Point Ollama URL and set model name in Settings (e.g., `llama3`, `llama3.1:8b`).

## SSH Tunnel (for remote Ollama)

Configure SSH host/user in Settings. Use the SSH Tunnel Control buttons to start/stop the tunnel.

## Troubleshooting

- "Import could not be resolved" in editor: ensure youâ€™re using the `.venv` Python in your editor. The app still runs if packages are installed in `.venv`.
- Widget state errors: Avoid setting widget-related keys in `st.session_state`. Configuration saves only whitelist known config keys.
- Gemini calls failing: confirm your API key and model name in Settings.
- Pandas not installed: tables fall back to text; install `pandas` for DataFrame previews.

## Tips

- The app shows the SQL used for retrieval so you can trust and verify results.
- You can save and reload conversations in the sidebar.
